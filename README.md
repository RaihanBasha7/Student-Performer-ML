# Exploratory Data Analysis
- Analyzed student performance dataset
- Visualized relationships between study hours, attendance, and scores
- Identified key features influencing final performance
# Data Preprocessing
- Selected relevant features influencing student performance
- Handled missing values
- Applied feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Split data into training and testing sets
# Model Training
- Trained a Linear Regression model on preprocessed student data
- Analyzed feature coefficients
- Generated predictions on unseen test data
# Results & Evaluation
- Achieved strong regression performance with low MAE
- R² score indicates good explanation of variance in student performance
- Residual analysis confirmed stable predictions
## Model Comparison
- Compared Linear Regression with Random Forest Regressor
- Random Forest achieved improved performance by capturing non-linear patterns
- Analyzed feature importance to understand key performance drivers
